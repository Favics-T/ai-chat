Task - AI-Powered Text Processing Interface
Using HTML, CSS and Js/Ts, React or any React Framework(eg. Next etc), develop build and host an AI-Powered Text Processing Interface using Chrome's AI APIs. This application will allow users to input text and utilize features such as summarization, translation, and language detection. Users should be able to interact with a clean, responsive UI that ensures accessibility and provides meaningful feedback for errors.
Requirements
Summary:
The UI should look like a chat interface with a textarea field in the bottom of the page and the output field should be the the area above.
When a user inputs a text and send, The text should Immediately render in the output area just like a normal chat window.
Use the Language detector API to detect the text language and render it below the output text.
Right below the text,
Summarize: If the text is more than 150 characters, render a button below the text that reads "Summarize". Make use of the Summarizer API to achieve this.
Translate: Render a simple select option field to switch between the languages listed below and a button that reads "Translate" to  translate the output text to the selected language. Use the Translator API.
English(en)
Portuguese (pt)
Spanish (es)
Russian (ru)
Turkish (tr)
French (fr)
Render the translated or(and) summarized output below the initial output text.
NOTE: For summary, render the Summarize button only for output texts that are in English language.
Core Features
Input Display:  Render a large, user-friendly textarea field for users to type or paste text and a send button that displays only a send icon.
Language Selector:  Allow users to choose between languages listed above.
Action Buttons:  Render two(2) action buttons(Summarize and Translate) to process the output text.
Output Display:  Display the processed result (summary, translation, or detected language) in a styled output area.
API Integration:
Use the selected Chrome AI API to process the input text asynchronously.
Handle API responses and errors gracefully, ensuring users receive helpful feedback in case of issues.
Accessibility:
Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable and accessible with screen readers.
Provide meaningful ARIA labels and focus indicators for input fields and buttons.
Responsive Design:
Optimize the layout for different screen sizes, ensuring usability on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
Use a flexible grid or stacked layout to enhance the user experience on smaller screens.
Acceptance Criteria
Functionality:
Users can input text, send text and it renders in the output field.
Users should be able to summarize text outputs if the output text is more than 150 characters.
Users should be able to translate output texts to the different languages listed.
The app should successfully communicate with the Chrome AI APIs to retrieve accurate results.
Display processed results in the output area after API calls are complete.
Error Handling:
Show an error message if:
The API call fails.
The input text is empty or invalid.
Error messages should be clear.
Responsive Design:
The interface must adjust appropriately to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
Code Quality:
Use modular, readable code with proper comments and structure.
Implement async/await or Promises for API calls and error handling.
Submission Mode

Hosted the application on a platform of your choice (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).
Provided the hosted page URL and GitHub repository link in the submission form.
Verified the functionality, responsiveness, and accessibility of your app.
Submission Deadline
The deadline for submission is Friday 21st Feb 2025, 11:59 PM WAT. Late submissions will not be accepted.

That’s not how I did mine.
This is the steps I followed:
So first go to this site:
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai
Then click on available apis.
Read through the built in AI apis article to understand all their apis
Then start with the first one. You’ll see it at the sidebar ‘Translator API’ click on that one and read through it.
when reading through it, you’ll reach the ‘get started’ sub heading. The ‘sign up for the origin trial’ method is for those that already have a website. For us testing locally, you’ll follow the ‘add support to local host’ method.
And voila! You’ll reach where I am.
Ask any question you have after that.



if Optimization device manager is not located on crome componenets

window.ai.languageModel.create();

If you have the "The device is not eligible for running on-device model.", Here are the steps on how you can fix it:
First, head to chrome://flags/ and enable the Optimization Guide On Device feature. Set it to Enabled ByPassPerfRequirement, then restart Chrome. Once Chrome restarts, go to chrome://components/, where you should see the Optimization Guide On Device Model with version 0.0.0.0. Start the download of this component, which is about 3GB in size and will take roughly 40 minutes to complete.
While waiting for the Optimization Guide to download, you can proceed to enable the Summarizer feature in chrome://flags/. After enabling it, you can check if the Summarizer API is active using the following code:

if ('ai' in self && 'summarizer' in 
self.ai) {
  // The Summarizer API is supported.
}
If the Summarizer API is supported, initiate its download with this script, which includes a progress monitor to track the download:
const summarizer = await ai.summarizer.create({
  monitor(m) {
    m.addEventListener('downloadprogress', (e) => {
      console.log(`Downloaded ${e.loaded} of ${e.total} bytes.`);
    });
  }
});
The Summarizer API is about 2.35GB in size and will take approximately 30 minutes to download. You can download both the Optimization Guide and the Summarizer API simultaneously.

go to the developer origin trials https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials/#/trials/my, sign back in again, the error should be fixed

 there are no fetch functions involved
I think the keys are simply used underneath the hood by the gemini Nano AI to make authorized calls

In your html file, add a meta tag with the content attribute set to the api key. Add this meta tag for the three API keys, don't forget to add the attribute, http-equiv = "", i seem to have forgotten the string for the http. I am sure yall can figure it out
